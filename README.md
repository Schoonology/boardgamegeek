# JavaScript BoardGameGeek client

A read-only JSON client for the BoardGameGeek API.

## Original documentation

The original documentation can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2).

## Alternatives

If you search NPM, you'll realize there are several alternatives to this library:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/bgg
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/bgg-axios
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/bgg-get
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/bgg-api

That said, I wanted a library with fewer dependencies, better performance, and a more natural JSON format. This is that library.
